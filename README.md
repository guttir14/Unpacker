## Be wary of
- Imports analyzer calls virtualized routines to determine where they lead
- Unpacker calls EP to unpack the binary and determine where OEP is
## Features: 
- Restores OEP
- Finds imports (even protected) and prints them to file
## TODO:
- Apply found imports to unpacked PE
- Something I haven't imagined yet
